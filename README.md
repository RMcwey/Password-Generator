#Password-Generator
1. Description: This is a password generator that is supposed to display a randomly generated password. It is supposed to have prompts for the user to select certain criteria that they would like to use in generating their password. The pass word generated needed to be a specific length between 8-128 that the user would select. 
2. My Role: I was given the html and css for the project and required to develop the functions of the program in JavaScript. I have left comments on my work and caused the password generator to work according to the desired criteria and user story.
